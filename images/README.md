# <Portfolio>

## Description

This website was designed as a starting point for my portfolio which I will improve over the duration of my course. 
In its contents are sections about myself, my work and how to get in contact with me. The website is styled using CSS
and flexbox; it also has a reponsive layout so it will adapt to all screen sizes. Throughout the creation and formatting 
of the website, I learnt quite a lot about CSS selectors, media queries and much more. I can only hope to further my education
in web development and in turn improve my portfolio with more IT resources.
